2. A stakes section
    - It's hard to make new friends as an adult and friends are one of the joys of life. If your life is busy you're missing out on turning those chance encounters into rewarding relationships.

3. Value proposition section
    1. Turn new acquaintances into friends
        - Our AI uses "relationship science" to pick the perfect time and place for follow-up meetings with a new acquaintance
        - We use social network information and event calendars in your area to make "smart suggestions" for activities you'll both enjoy
    2. Strengthen existing relationships
        - We suggest friends with similar interests to participate in activites they'd be interested in (that you're already going to)
        - Never miss a birthday + send relationship-strengthing gifts
        - Know exactly who to connect with when you're traveling... all on autopilot
    3. Maintain important long-term relationships
        - Schedule occasional check-ins
        - Monitor life-events
        - Send birthday cards and gifts via Uber?
    4. Focus on building relationships with the people who matter most
        - Our "inner circle" system helps you focus on the relationships you want the most

4. A guide section
    - Our team is a bunch of expats that moved to Kaohsuing, and when you move you have to make new friends. We always wanted something that would ease the complex process of getting to know new people and keeping in touch with old friends and that's why we came up with Friend AI.
